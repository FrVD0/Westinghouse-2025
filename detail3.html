          <p>
            I 
            was not meant to be still.
This twist of iron 
once followed the shape of flameâ€” 
now it rusts in the name of permanence.
Children pass, fingertips trailing 
across my ribs, and wonder what I mean.
A man takes photos, but never sees me. 
Only his own shadow bending on my skin.
Once I soared. Or tried. Or was meant to try.
Now I settle for catching the afternoon light 
on one smooth curve where no birds land.
