          <p>
          When Caroline was little, instead of saying <br>
“butterfly”, she would say “buggerfly” <br>
It’s okay Maddy spells Alina's name “Aliena” <br>
She’s the one who was kicked out of ballerina school <br>
For distracting the other children who followed <br>
Her instructions instead of the teacher’s <br>
When Jon Batiste sees he sees beautiful,<br>
He sees joy, life, he sees patent leather gold- <br>
Trimmed shoes that laser beam their shine <br>
Throughout the Boston Opera House <br>
As he mystifies across the stage, he sees <br>
you don’t only have to play the piano keys, <br>
you can also play the strings under the piano’s lid<br>
When we chanted the bridge to his “Butterfly”<br>
The wings of the stage dissolved, the ceiling<br>
Turned into the York cathedral I once sat in<br>
To hear the choir boys practice their angelic tones<br>
We were no longer skin and blood and bone<br>
No longer atoms and elements aging and dying<br>
We were star stuff, sound simply, complex<br>
Hearts beating out a Sacred sound, a tapestry <br>
So supreme, all of us buggers, flying home<br>
