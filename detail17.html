          <p>
            We were happy it snowed that night<br> 
And decided to have a snowball fight.<br> 
While lobbing the snowy orbs at each other<br>  
There was nowhere to run for cover<br> 
We threw them all over the place<br> 
Some of what they threw missed my face<br> 
Looking back as I recall<br>   
Mine always hit the brick wall<br> 
Unlike me, it was sturdy, and strong<br> 
It took a beating all day long<br>
