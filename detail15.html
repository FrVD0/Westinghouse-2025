            Hello Area 31, Minas Gerais. <br>
Is anyone there? The payphone rings and rings <br>
within its aging booth’s blue bonnet. <br>
No one walks your hot midday concrete <br>
or steps up onto the high sooty curb <br>
built to rise above sudden tropical torrents. <br>
A blaze of bright ochre and burnt umber walls <br>
conceals cool courtyards and café com leite lives. <br>
</p>
<p>
A cachorro merely two stairs tall <br>
sits outside those walls, meditates <br>
in a triangle of respite and focus, <br>
body still, but ears at alert. <br>
Like your early citizens, Minas, their <br>
rebellions crushed again and again <br>
until finally, liberation, we, too, will resist. <br>
We persist, like the puppy who waits. <br>
</p>
<p>
Two-year-old Manu, American girl <br>
plucked from her birth land, to Minas Gerais <br>
a ‘homeland’ she has never called home. <br>
And how many others? <br>
We will answer the call. We will step up. <br>
We will rise like floodwaters to attain your motto: <br>
Libertas quæ sera tamen: <br>
Liberty, though it be delayed. <br>
</p>
