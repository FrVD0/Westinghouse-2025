          <p>
            A song once slept inside these keys, 
            its breath suspended in the dust. 
            A chord unfinished, lost to time— 
            the echo waits, and wait it must.
  
            The room remembers fingertips, 
            each note like rain upon the pane. 
            The silence here is symphony, 
            a minor grief that won’t explain.
            
            The light remembers how to fall, 
            just so, across the fractured wood. 
            The bench remembers how it swayed— 
            the hush before the last note stood.
            
            I sit and press a single key. 
            It sighs, but will not rise again. 
            The ghost of sound, still tethered there, 
            remains behind like phantom skin.
            
            This house forgets. The keys forget. 
            But somewhere still the song begins— 
            in shadowed halls of once and yet, 
            and what remains of violins.
