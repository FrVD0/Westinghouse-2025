          <p>
            The city lights spilled themselves across the water like they had secrets to confess but couldn’t form the words. I watched them tremble, stretch, snap back into silence. It felt like the moment before sleep, when thoughts melt and meanings blur, when you remember you once knew how to breathe underwater. Some colors move faster than others. The orange lights jitter like nervous laughter. The blue ones hold still, watching. White is the echo of a voice you almost remember. I reached out, but the river wasn’t listening. It was reciting something older, something about stars falling into rhythm with the tide.
