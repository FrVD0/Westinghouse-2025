    <p>  
      In Atlanta, there were so many ways to dance<br>
No time for study or sleep <br>
No farmer in the dell, no cheese standing alone. <br>
At the Masquerade, Wednesdays were industrial, <br>
Thursdays 80â€™s night, and the weekends ecstasy <br>
Fueled raves: Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and always<br>
Kazell the opener. Sasha at the Warehouse,<br>
Digweed too, and Sven Vath. Faith lost in everything<br>
But the synergy of pills, strobe lights, and a DJ<br>
Stomping away with us like a puppeteer his creations.<br>
Our feet were on the dance floor, <br>
But we felt lifted, aloft in the air, the music more<br>
Our heart beats than our own hearts.<br>
The club more life than life could offer<br>
In the daylight, on the outside, on the sober.<br>
Then, at some point, you have to go adult,<br>
Slow down, work, take care of aging parents, <br>
Pay the bills you racked up travelling around<br>
Seeking this high from New York to London.<br>
Soon, home is enough, and you are no longer<br>
A wormy thing, you are a feathery light<br>
Glowing mango, raspberry, pink lemonade<br>
Dancing sprite in the kitchen most the time machine.<br>
