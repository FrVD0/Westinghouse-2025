        <h1>Death Of A Ketchup Packet</h1>

          <p>
            Do you want to know why my french fries are wearing a frown? <br>
Because its ketchup packet fell to the ground <br>
Someone stepped on it and it splattered <br>
My french fries pretended that it didn’t matter <br>
Did someone pick up the damaged packet? <br>
Was it thrown in the litter basket? <br>
Sadly the packet died alone <br>
Its final resting place unknown <br>
And so my french fries sits lonely on a plate <br>
Ketchup-less, that’s their fate <br>
