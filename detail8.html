            They gathered where the cypress leans 
            and stars begin to show, 
            beneath the glow of paper lamps 
            and embers burning low.
  
            The table held what hands had made
            —a loaf, a peach, a stew— and stories 
            passed from mouth to mouth 
            like something old made new.
            
            A boy recited verses learned 
            beneath a quilted moon, 
            while elders tapped their feet in time 
            to fiddle, pipe, and tune.
            
            No book was kept, no names were carved, 
            no portrait hung in frame— 
            but every dish and dance that night 
            preserved the family name.
